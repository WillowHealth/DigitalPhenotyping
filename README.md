# Digital Phenotyping: MIT/Harvard Study

In this IRB-approved MIT/Harvard study, we are investigating the relationship between stress and sleep by collecting both physiological and self-reported data on stress and sleep. Based on this data, we will test an intervention for improving sleep quality that consists of an adaptive cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) that aims to improve outcomes of traditional CBT-I solutions in terms of user engagement and improving sleep quality.
